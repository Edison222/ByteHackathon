How can we tell if the air outside is safe? •Indicates whether pollutant levels in air may cause health concerns.•Ranges from 0 (least concern) to 500 (greatest concern).•For current air quality, visitAirNow.gov. AQI – Air Quality Index Government agencies
How has the Clean Air Act affected air pollution trends?
Concentration of criteria pollutants in ambient air across the US has steadily fallen
Burning fossil fuels produces acid rain•Burning fossil fuels releases sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides•These compounds react with water, oxygen, and oxidants to form sulfuric and nitric acids
How did we address the acid rain problem? •The Clear Air Act (1990) established an emissions trading programfor sulfur dioxide•Low sulfur coal•New technologies such as scrubbers have helped•Policies and regulations have lowered U.S. emissions of sulfur and nitrogen oxides 67% since 1989
How did the emissions trading system impact sulfur dioxide emissions? Sulfur dioxide emissions fell 67% since the emissions trading system
•How has the pH of precipitation changed under the Clean Air Act? •Precipitation has become less acidic as air quality has improved under the Clean Air Act
How has the Clean Air Act affected growth?
How was it possible to reduce pollutant emissions? •Federal policies and technology•Cleaner burning fuels•Fuel efficiency •Reduced SO2 emissions•Permit trading programs and clean coal technologies
How was it possible to reduce pollutant emissions? •Scrubbers•Chemically convert or physically remove pollutants before they leave smokestacks •Two main types•Wet – liquids•Dry - filters https://www.epa.gov/air-emissions-monitoring-knowledge-base/monitoring-control-technique-wet-scrubber-gaseous-control#box1
How was it possible to reduce pollutant emissions? http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4468076.stm Burning coal produces a range of pollutants that harm the environment: Sulphur dioxide (acid rain); nitrogen oxides (ground-level ozone) and particulates (affects people's respiratory systems)
What are some choices we can make to improve air quality? •Energy efficient vehicles•Electric vehicles, proper vehicle maintenance•Utilizing public transportation •Reduce per person emissions •Active transportation •Walking, cycling•Eco-friendly products•Low VOC paints, cleaning products•Supporting sustainable agriculture•Minimize emissions
What is the ozone layer? •Ozone in the lower stratosphere (good ozone) absorbs the sun’s ultraviolet (UV) radiation •UV radiation can damage tissues and DNA•Ozone-depleting substances, chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)•Human-made chemicals that destroy ozone•Halocarbons•Human-made compounds made from hydrocarbons with added chlorine, bromine, or fluorine
What is the ozone layer? https://scied.ucar.edu/learning-zone/atmosphere/ozone-layer
How do Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) work to destroy ozone? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniJx-vRHG0&nohtml5=False
How did we address ozone depletion? •Montreal Protocol (1987)•196 nations agreed to cut CFC production in half by 1998•Later agreements deepened cuts, advanced timetables, and addressed other ozone-depleting chemicals•Industry shifted to safer alternative chemicals•We stopped the Antarctic ozone hole from getting worse•Challenges still face us•CFCs will remain in the stratosphere for decades

NYC – Canadian wildfires https://www.the-express.com/news/us-news/102855/orange-smog-canadian-wildfires-new-york-city What are some health concerns related to polluted air?
What is the atmosphere? A thin layer of gases around Earth •Shield•Provides oxygen•Absorbs radiation and moderates climate•Transports and recycles water and nutrients78% N2, 21% O2, 1 % argon and trace amounts of other gases.
What is the atmosphere? •Water vapor•Trace amounts of•Argon•CO2•Neon•Helium•Methane•Trace gasesHuman activity is now changing the amount of some gases CO2, methane (CH4), ozone (O3)
How many layers are there in the Earth’s atmosphere? •Troposphere•Bottommost layer (11 km [7 miles])•Most of the mass •Responsible for Earth’s weather•The air gets colder with altitudeThe atmosphere can be divided into four main layers.
How many layers are there in the Earth’s atmosphere? •Stratosphere•11–50 km (7–31 mi) above sea level•Drier and less dense, with little vertical mixing•Gets warmer with altitude•Many jet aircrafts fly here•Ozone layer•Blocks UV radiation
How many layers are there in the Earth’s atmosphere? MesosphereLow air pressure, Gets colder with altitudeThermosphereTop layerThe aurora mostly occur in the thermosphere
What is a thermal inversion?Normal conditions§ Air become cooler with altitude§ Allows vertical mixing§ Dispersal of pollutants
Inversions affect air quality•A layer of cool air forms beneath warm air•The band of air where temperature rises with altitude•Dense, cool air at the bottom of the layer resists mixing During a thermal inversion, a layer of cool air forms over a layer of warm air and traps air pollutants near the surface, leading to unsafe air quality.
12➢In thermal inversions, the normal temperature patterns reverse.▻The dense cold air doesn’t rise.▻Pollution accumulates.
1948 – Donora smog•Thermal inversion•Trapped pollutants over the town•Five-day episode - 1000's became ill, 20 people died in a week•zinc smelting plant,•steel mills’ furnaces,•sulfuric acid plant http://www.eoearth.org/view/article/151779/Build up of CO2, NO2, SO2, F2
What is air pollution? Substances added to the atmosphere by natural events or human activities in high enough concentrations to be harmful. http://greenliving.lovetoknow.com/Types_of_Pollution
What are the two main categories of air pollution? •Primary pollutants - products of natural events (like fires and volcanic eruptions) and human activities added directly to the air•Secondary pollutants - formed by interaction of primary pollutants with each other or with normal components of the air
Class817TypesofPollutants Emitteddirectly intoair 10/28/18Formedfrom reactionof primarypollutants and/orair components
Carbon monoxide (CO)• odorless, colorless, poisonous gas• created by incomplete combustion (motor vehicles, industrial processes, burning biomass)• combines with hemoglobin in blood & may create problems for infants, the elderly, & those with heart or respiratory diseases
https://www.epa.gov/co-pollution Holland tunnel air vent
Sulfur oxidesMainly sulfur dioxide,(SO2)Produced largely from combustion of coal & oil (esp. coal)•Responsible for acid rain problem•can react with gases in atmosphere to form sulfuric acid (secondary air pollutant)
Sulfur oxides•Impairment of respiratory function•Aggravation of existing respiratory disease (especially bronchitis)•Decrease in the ability of the lungs to clear foreign particles•Asthmatics, individuals with cardiovascular disease, elderly and children
Oxides of nitrogenNO (nitric oxide) & NO2(nitrogen dioxide)•Emitted directly by motor vehicles & industrial activities (burning fossil fuels)•Responsible for acid rain problem•Can react with other gases in atmosphere to from nitric acid (HNO3) (secondary air pollutant)
Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) •Methane, benzene, propane, & chlorofluorocarbons (CFC's)•Sources include: motor vehicles, industry, &various household products•Eye and respiratory tract irritation, headaches, dizziness, visual disorders, and memory impairment•VOCs are consistently higher indoors than outdoors.
Suspended particulate matterParticulate Matter (dust, ash, salt particles) Suspended solid or liquid particles•Sources include incomplete combustion (smoke), power plants, iron/steel mills, land clearing, highway construction, mining•Act as respiratory irritants; some are known carcinogens (e.g., asbestos)•Can aggravate heart/respiratory diseases
Particulate matter 2.5, 10
Major PM2.5 pollution from traffic is not evenly distributed throughout the city https://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/traffic/index.html
Toxic compoundsTrace amounts of at least 600 toxic substances (such as mercury and lead) produced by human activities•Sources of mercury are from burning coal and waste (such as medical wastes)•Serious health effects on humans and wildlife
Ground level ozone (O3) Interaction between NOx and VOCs in the presence of sunlight•Summertime, urban areas, largely industrialized communities•Can cause respiratory problems•EPA provides maps showing levels of ozone pollutionhttps://www.airnow.gov/
How is acid rain produced? Sulfur dioxide (SO2) and oxides of nitrogen (NOx) can form acidic particles when they react with water: SO2 + H2O --> H2SO4 (sulfuric acid) NOx + H2O --> HNO3 (nitric acid)Impacts1.Harmful to lakes, streams, forests2.Leaching of nutrients such as calcium and potassium ions from topsoil.3.Damaging to buildings, sculptures and statues
➢Acid precipitation has a pH lower than normal rain.▻Normal rain has a pH of about 5.6 due to carbonic acid.▻Acid rain has a pH of 4.2-4.4 due to sulfuric and nitric acid. Neutral solutionsStrongest AcidStrongest Base Normal rain Acid Rain10x more acidic
Effects of acid rain 1944 2002George Washington, New YorkAcid rain is estimated to cause $5 billion in damages annually in a 17-state region by corroding buildings and other structures. http://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/18/us/draft-study-puts-acid-rain-damage-at-5-billion-for-17-states.html
Industrial smog results from coal and oil combustion -Mix of smoke, sulfur oxides & sulfuric acid
Photochemical smog (LA smog)-appears as a brownish haze- results when pollutants from automobile exhaust react amid exposure to light -high levels of ground level ozone, nitrogen oxides, PM and a mix of other chemicals-respiratory problems and other health issues
